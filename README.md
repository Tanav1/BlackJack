# Blackjack Game

This Python script represents a simple implementation of a Blackjack card game. It allows players to play rounds of Blackjack against a dealer.

## Introduction

The `BlackjackGame` script is designed to create a Blackjack game with a dealer and multiple players. It initializes the game with a list of player names, allowing them to play rounds against the dealer. Players aim to achieve a card sum as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Download the script `blackjack_game.py` and the player and dealer classes (`player.py` and `dealer.py`) to the same directory.

3. Customize the player names in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section if needed.

4. Run the script:

   ```shell
   python blackjack_game.py
